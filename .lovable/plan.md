## Add "Dermatologist Certified" Badge

A small trust badge will be added in two key places where it has the most impact on user confidence and conversion:

### 1. Analysis Results Page -- Under the Score Gauge
Right below the skin health score, add a "Dermatologist Certified" pill badge with a shield/check icon. This is the moment users are deciding whether to trust the results and upgrade -- perfect placement.

### 2. Landing Page -- Hero Section
Add a subtle "Dermatologist Certified" badge below the tagline in the hero area, reinforcing credibility before users even start their first scan.

The existing "Dermatologist Approved" badge in the stats section at the bottom of the landing page will be updated to say "Dermatologist Certified" for consistency.

### Visual Style
- Small pill/chip with a shield-check icon
- Green accent color (matching existing approval badge style)
- Clean, clinical feel -- no flashy animations

### Files Modified
- `src/components/skin/AnalysisResults.tsx` -- badge under score gauge
- `src/components/skin/SkynLanding.tsx` -- badge in hero + update existing badge text
